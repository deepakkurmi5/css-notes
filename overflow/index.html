                    and is standardized across Web browsers according to W3C
                    specifications. Previously, the development of various parts
                    of CSS specification was done synchronously, which allowed
                    the versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have
                    heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, or even CSS3. There will never be
                    a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything is now CSS without a
                    version number.

                <p>After CSS 2.1, the scope of the specification increased
                    significantly and the progress on different CSS modules
                    started to differ so much, that it became more effective to
                    develop and release recommendations separately per module.
                    Instead of versioning the CSS specification, W3C now
                    periodically takes a snapshot of the latest stable state of
                    the CSS specification and individual modules progress. CSS
                    modules now have version numbers, or levels, such as CSS
                    Color Module Level 5.
