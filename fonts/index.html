            <p>In many financial transactions, it is customary to quote prices
                in other ways. The most obvious example is in pricing a loan,
                when the cost will be expressed as the percentage rate of
                interest. The total amount of interest payable depends upon
                credit risk, the loan amount and the period of the loan. Other
                examples can be found in pricing financial derivatives and other
                financial assets. For instance the price of inflation-linked
                government securities in several countries is quoted as the
                actual price divided by a factor representing inflation since
                the security was issued.
