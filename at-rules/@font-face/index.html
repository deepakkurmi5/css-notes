            <h1>Font Properties Of CSS</h1>

            <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to
                describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML
                (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS
                describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper,
                in speech, or on other media. CSS is among the core languages of
                the open web and is standardized across Web browsers according
                to W3C specifications. Previously, the development of various
                parts of CSS specification was done synchronously,
                which allowed the versioning of the latest recommendations. You
                might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, or even CSS3. There will
                never be a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything is now CSS without
                a version number. After CSS 2.1, the scope of the
                specification increased significantly and the progress on
                different CSS modules started to differ so much, that it became
                more effective to develop and release recommendations separately
                per module. Instead of versioning the CSS specification,
                W3C now periodically takes a snapshot of the latest stable state
                of the CSS specification and individual modules progress. CSS
                modules now have version numbers, or levels, such as CSS Color
