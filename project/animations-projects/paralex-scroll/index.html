                <p>A scroll progress timeline, which is progressed through by
                    scrolling a scrollable element (scroller) between top and
                    bottom (or left and right). The position in the scroll range
                    is converted into a percentage of progress — 0% at the start
                    and 100% at the end. The element that provides the scroll
                    progress timeline can be specified in two ways:
                    A named scroll progress timeline is one where the scroller
                    providing the scroll progress timeline is explicitly named
                    using the scroll-timeline-name property (or the
                    scroll-timeline shorthand property). The name is then linked
                    to the element to animate by specifying it as the value of
                    that element's animation-timeline property.
                    An anonymous scroll progress timeline is one where the
                    element to animate is given a scroll() function as an
                    animation-timeline value, which selects the scroller
                    providing the scroll progress timeline and the scroll axis
                    to be used based on the arguments you pass to it.
                    A view progress timeline, which is progressed through based
                    on the change in visibility of an element (known as the
                    subject) inside a scroller. The visibility of the subject
                    inside the scroller is tracked — by default, the timeline is
                    at 0% when the subject is first visible at one edge of the
                    scroller, and 100% when it reaches the opposite edge. Unlike
                    with scroll progress timelines, you can't specify the
                    scroller — the subject's visibility is always tracked within
                    its nearest ancestor scroller. The subject that provides the
                    view progress timeline can be specified in two ways:
