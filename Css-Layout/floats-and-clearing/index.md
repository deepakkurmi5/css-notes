## Definition and Usage

* The float property specifies whether an element should float to the left, right, or not at all.

* The float property is used for positioning and formatting content e.g. let an image float left to the text in a container.

--- The float property can have one of the following values:

- left - The element floats to the left of its container
- right - The element floats to the right of its container
- none - The element does not float (will be displayed just where it occurs in the text). This is    
  default
- inherit - The element inherits the float value of its parent
  In its simplest use, the float property can be used to wrap text around images.
