            Tribhuvan of Nepal at his coronation
            Tribhuvan (1906-1955) was King of Nepal from 11 December 1911 until
            his death. Born in the Nepalese capital, Kathmandu, he ascended to
            the throne at the age of five, upon the death of his father Prithvi
            Bir Bikram Shah, and was crowned in 1913 with his mother acting as
            regent. At the time of his crowning, the position of monarch was
            largely ceremonial, with the real governing power residing with the
            Rana dynasty. During World War I, the Ranas wanted Nepal to join the
            war in support of the United Kingdom, while the royal family wished
            to remain neutral. Eventually, Prime Minister Chandra Shumsher Jung
            Bahadur Rana pressured the young king while threatening his mother,
            forcing him to order the troops to war. This photograph, held by
            Madan Puraskar Pustakalaya, was taken at Tribhuvan's coronation in
            1911.</div>
